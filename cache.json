Recent methods for memory mitigation have primarily\naddressed the issue within the context of the text modality in cross-modal\ngeneration tasks, restricting their applicability to specific conditions. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel method for diffusion models from the perspective\nof visual modality, which is more generic and fundamental for mitigating\nmemorization. Directly exposing visual data to the model increases memorization\nrisk, so we design a framework where models learn through proxy model\nparameters instead. Specially, the training dataset is divided into multiple\nshards, with each shard training a proxy model, then aggregated to form the\nfinal model. Additionally, practical analysis of training losses illustrates\nthat the losses for easily memorable images tend to be obviously lower. Thus,\nwe skip the samples with abnormally low loss values from the current mini-batch\nto avoid memorizing. However, balancing the need to skip memorization-prone\nsamples while maintaining sufficient training data for high-quality image\ngeneration presents a key challenge. Thus, we propose IET-AGC+, which\nredistributes highly memorizable samples between shards, to mitigate these\nsamples from over-skipping. Furthermore, we dynamically augment samples based\non their loss values to further reduce memorization. Extensive experiments and\nanalysis on four datasets show that our method successfully reduces memory\ncapacity while maintaining performance. Moreover, we fine-tune the pre-trained\ndiffusion models, e.g., Stable Diffusion, and decrease the memorization score\nby 46.7\\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

However, real-world drone-viewed RGBT data\nsuffers from the prominent position shift problem, i.e., the position of a tiny\nobject differs greatly in different modalities. For instance, a slight\ndeviation of a tiny object in the thermal modality will induce it to drift from\nthe main body of itself in the RGB modality. Considering RGBT data are usually\nlabeled on one modality (reference), this will cause the unlabeled modality\n(sensed) to lack accurate supervision signals and prevent the detector from\nlearning a good representation. Moreover, the mismatch of the corresponding\nfeature point between the modalities will make the fused features confusing for\nthe detection head. In this paper, we propose to cast the cross-modality box\nshift issue as the label noise problem and address it on the fly via a novel\nMean Teacher-based Cross-modality Box Correction head ensemble (CBC). In this\nway, the network can learn more informative representations for both\nmodalities.

To extract\ndegradation-independent structure prior, we introduce a Processor with RGB and\nFFT constraints to extract structure prior from the low-quality images, guiding\nthe diffusion model and preventing the generation of unreasonable artifacts.\nLastly, we employ a multi-level attention mechanism to integrate the acquired\nsemantic and structure priors. The qualitative and quantitative results\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods overall\non both synthetic and real-world datasets.

We modify the vanilla transformer to be depth-aware and guide the\nwhole detection process by contextual depth cues. Specifically, concurrent to\nthe visual encoder that captures object appearances, we introduce to predict a\nforeground depth map, and specialize a depth encoder to extract non-local depth\nembeddings. Then, we formulate 3D object candidates as learnable queries and\npropose a depth-guided decoder to conduct object-scene depth interactions. In\nthis way, each object query estimates its 3D attributes adaptively from the\ndepth-guided regions on the image and is no longer constrained to local visual\nfeatures. On KITTI benchmark with monocular images as input, MonoDETR achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance and requires no extra dense depth annotations.\nBesides, our depth-guided modules can also be plug-and-play to enhance\nmulti-view 3D object detectors on nuScenes dataset, demonstrating our superior\ngeneralization capacity.

To this end, this paper pioneers exploring Mamba, a new\nparadigm for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity, for\nefficient and effective MRI reconstruction.

While natural\nselection has produced these eyes through countless mutations over millions of\nyears, they represent just one set of realized evolutionary paths. Testing\nhypotheses about how environmental pressures shaped eye evolution remains\nchallenging since we cannot experimentally isolate individual factors.\nComputational evolution offers a way to systematically explore alternative\ntrajectories. Here we show how environmental demands drive three fundamental\naspects of visual evolution through an artificial evolution framework that\nco-evolves both physical eye structure and neural processing in embodied\nagents. First, we demonstrate computational evidence that task specific\nselection drives bifurcation in eye evolution - orientation tasks like\nnavigation in a maze leads to distributed compound-type eyes while an object\ndiscrimination task leads to the emergence of high-acuity camera-type eyes.\nSecond, we reveal how optical innovations like lenses naturally emerge to\nresolve fundamental tradeoffs between light collection and spatial precision.\nThird, we uncover systematic scaling laws between visual acuity and neural\nprocessing, showing how task complexity drives coordinated evolution of sensory\nand computational capabilities. Our work introduces a novel paradigm that\nilluminates evolutionary principles shaping vision by creating targeted\nsingle-player games where embodied agents must simultaneously evolve visual\nsystems and learn complex behaviors. Through our unified genetic encoding\nframework, these embodied agents serve as next-generation hypothesis testing\nmachines while providing a foundation for designing manufacturable bio-inspired\nvision systems.

Fervor for concept generation is\nincreasing rapidly among users, and platforms for concept sharing have sprung\nup. The concept owners may upload malicious concepts and disguise them with\nnon-malicious text descriptions and example images to deceive users into\ndownloading and generating malicious content. The platform needs a quick method\nto determine whether a concept is malicious to prevent the spread of malicious\nconcepts. However, simply relying on concept image generation to judge whether\na concept is malicious requires time and computational resources. Especially,\nas the number of concepts uploaded and downloaded on the platform continues to\nincrease, this approach becomes impractical and poses a risk of generating\nmalicious content. In this paper, we propose Concept QuickLook, the first\nsystematic work to incorporate malicious concept detection into research, which\nperforms detection based solely on concept files without generating any images.\nWe define malicious concepts and design two work modes for detection: concept\nmatching and fuzzy detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed Concept QuickLook can detect malicious concepts and demonstrate\npracticality in concept sharing platforms. We also design robustness\nexperiments to further validate the effectiveness of the solution.

Lastly, we demonstrate empirically that this aspect of label\nsmoothing and Mixup can be a positive and a negative. On the one hand, we show\nthat the strong performance of label smoothing and Mixup on image\nclassification benchmarks is correlated with learning low variance hidden\nrepresentations.

Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) is a recently proposed\napproach that combines pre-trained multimodal LLMs such as vision-language\nmodels with federated learning to create personalized, privacy-preserving AI\nsystems. However, balancing the competing goals of personalization,\ngeneralization, and privacy remains a significant challenge.\nOver-personalization can lead to overfitting, reducing generalizability, while\nstringent privacy measures, such as differential privacy, can hinder both\npersonalization and generalization. In this paper, we propose a Differentially\nPrivate Federated Prompt Learning (DP-FPL) approach to tackle this challenge by\nleveraging a low-rank factorization scheme to capture generalization while\nmaintaining a residual term that preserves expressiveness for personalization.\nTo ensure privacy, we introduce a novel method where we apply local\ndifferential privacy to the two low-rank components of the local prompt, and\nglobal differential privacy to the global prompt.

Existing generalist graph models have\nachieved remarkable success in different graph tasks but struggle to generalize\nto the GAD task. This limitation arises from their difficulty in learning\ngeneralized knowledge for capturing the inherently infrequent, irregular and\nheterogeneous abnormality patterns in graphs from different domains. To address\nthis challenge, we propose AnomalyGFM, a GAD-oriented graph foundation model\nthat supports zero-shot inference and few-shot prompt tuning for GAD in diverse\ngraph datasets. One key insight is that graph-agnostic representations for\nnormal and abnormal classes are required to support effective zero/few-shot GAD\nacross different graphs. Motivated by this, AnomalyGFM is pre-trained to align\ndata-independent, learnable normal and abnormal class prototypes with node\nrepresentation residuals (i.e., representation deviation of a node from its\nneighbors). The residual features essentially project the node information into\na unified feature space where we can effectively measure the abnormality of\nnodes from different graphs in a consistent way. This provides a driving force\nfor the learning of graph-agnostic, discriminative prototypes for the normal\nand abnormal classes, which can be used to enable zero-shot GAD on new graphs,\nincluding very large-scale graphs. If there are few-shot labeled normal nodes\navailable in the new graphs, AnomalyGFM can further support prompt tuning to\nleverage these nodes for better adaptation.

Ideally, these local embeddings should encode meaningful\nrepresentations of the unique dynamics of each sequence. However, when these\nare learned end-to-end as parameters of a forecasting model, they may end up\nacting as mere sequence identifiers.

This often yields\nsuboptimal performance as it fails to leverage the synergy between fine-tuning\nand quantization. To effectively realize low-bit quantization of weights,\nactivations, and KV caches in LLMs, we propose an algorithm named Rotated\nStraight-Through-Estimator (RoSTE), which combines quantization-aware\nsupervised fine-tuning (QA-SFT) with an adaptive rotation strategy that\nidentifies an effective rotation configuration to reduce activation outliers.\nWe provide theoretical insights on RoSTE by analyzing its prediction error when\napplied to an overparameterized least square quantized training problem.

Invariant learning, aiming\nto extract invariant features across varied distributions, has recently emerged\nas a promising approach for OOD generation. Despite the great success of\ninvariant learning in OOD problems for Euclidean data (i.e., images), the\nexploration within graph data remains constrained by the complex nature of\ngraphs. Existing studies, such as data augmentation or causal intervention,\neither suffer from disruptions to invariance during the graph manipulation\nprocess or face reliability issues due to a lack of supervised signals for\ncausal parts. In this work, we propose a novel framework, called Invariant\nGraph Learning based on Information bottleneck theory (InfoIGL), to extract the\ninvariant features of graphs and enhance models' generalization ability to\nunseen distributions. Specifically, InfoIGL introduces a redundancy filter to\ncompress task-irrelevant information related to environmental factors.\nCooperating with our designed multi-level contrastive learning, we maximize the\nmutual information among graphs of the same class in the downstream\nclassification tasks, preserving invariant features for prediction to a great\nextent. An appealing feature of InfoIGL is its strong generalization ability\nwithout depending on supervised signal of invariance.

An important subclass of\ndata augmentation techniques - which includes both label smoothing and Mixup -\ninvolves modifying not only the input data but also the input label during\nmodel training. In this work, we analyze the role played by the label\naugmentation aspect of such methods. We first prove that linear models on\nbinary classification data trained with label augmentation learn only the\nminimum variance features in the data, while standard training (which includes\nweight decay) can learn higher variance features. We then use our techniques to\nshow that even for nonlinear models and general data distributions, the label\nsmoothing and Mixup losses are lower bounded by a function of the model output\nvariance. Lastly, we demonstrate empirically that this aspect of label\nsmoothing and Mixup can be a positive and a negative. On the one hand, we show\nthat the strong performance of label smoothing and Mixup on image\nclassification benchmarks is correlated with learning low variance hidden\nrepresentations. On the other hand, we show that Mixup and label smoothing can\nbe more susceptible to low variance spurious correlations in the training data.\n","authors":["Muthu Chidambaram","Rong Ge"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06855v3.pdf","comment":"ICLR 2025, 25 pages, 8 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02075v2","updated":"2025-02-13T02:57:47Z","published":"2023-07-05T07:32:34Z","title":"Combating Confirmation Bias: A Unified Pseudo-Labeling Framework for\n  Entity Alignment","summary":"  Entity alignment (EA) aims at identifying equivalent entity pairs across\ndifferent knowledge graphs (KGs) that refer to the same real-world identity.

It provides a\ncomprehensive and in-depth overview of the existing methods, with dual views of\ndetailed taxonomy that answer the key research questions including how to\nencode time series as images and how to model the imaged time series for\nvarious tasks. Additionally, we address the challenges in the pre- and\npost-processing steps involved in this framework and outline future directions\nto further advance time series analysis with vision models.\n","authors":["Jingchao Ni","Ziming Zhao","ChengAo Shen","Hanghang Tong","Dongjin Song","Wei Cheng","Dongsheng Luo","Haifeng Chen"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08869v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01476v2","updated":"2025-02-13T00:41:05Z","published":"2023-12-03T18:23:48Z","title":"Optimizing Context-Enhanced Relational Joins","summary":"  Collecting data, extracting value, and combining insights from relational and\ncontext-rich multi-modal sources in data processing pipelines presents a\nchallenge for traditional relational DBMS.

Despite its\npopularity, existing theoretical guarantees of CE are limited to settings\nsatisfying restrictive fluid regularity conditions, particularly, the\nnon-degeneracy conditions, under the widely held belief that the violation of\nsuch conditions leads to performance deterioration and necessitates algorithmic\ninnovation beyond CE.\n  In this work, we conduct a refined performance analysis of CE within the\ngeneral framework of online linear programming. We show that CE achieves\nuniformly near-optimal regret (up to a polylogarithmic factor in $T$) under\nonly mild assumptions on the underlying distribution, without relying on any\nfluid regularity conditions. Our result implies that, contrary to prior belief,\nCE effectively beats the curse of degeneracy for a wide range of problem\ninstances with continuous conditional reward distributions, highlighting the\ndistinction of the problem's structure between discrete and non-discrete\nsettings.

However, the vast\ncombinatorial space of possible expressions poses significant challenges for\nboth online search methods and pre-trained transformer models. Additionally,\ncurrent state-of-the-art approaches typically do not consider the integration\nof domain experts' prior knowledge and do not support iterative interactions\nwith the model during the equation discovery process. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Symbolic Q-network (Sym-Q), an advanced interactive\nframework for large-scale symbolic regression. Unlike previous large-scale\ntransformer-based SR approaches, Sym-Q leverages reinforcement learning without\nrelying on a transformer-based decoder. This formulation allows the agent to\nlearn through offline reinforcement learning using any type of tree encoder,\nenabling more efficient training and inference. Furthermore, we propose a\nco-design mechanism, where the reinforcement learning-based Sym-Q facilitates\neffective interaction with domain experts at any stage of the equation\ndiscovery process. Users can dynamically modify generated nodes of the\nexpression, collaborating with the agent to tailor the mathematical expression\nto best fit the problem and align with the assumed physical laws, particularly\nwhen there is prior partial knowledge of the expected behavior. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that the pre-trained Sym-Q surpasses existing SR algorithms on the\nchallenging SSDNC benchmark.

Although there are various synthetic data generation techniques, they\nare often not tailored to the unique characteristics of transportation data,\nsuch as the inherent structure of transportation networks formed by all trips\nin the datasets.

Cross-scale\nwindow-based attention is inspired by the attention mechanism in transformers\nand effectively enlarges the receptive field. Both the feature encoding module\nand the cross-scale window-based attention module in our architecture are\nflexible and can be incorporated into any other network architecture. We\nevaluate our method on the Kodak and CLIC datasets and demonstrate that our\napproach is effective and on par with state-of-the-art methods.

Traditional MRI reconstruction methods aim to\nexpedite this process by filling in missing frequency components in the\nK-space, performing 3D-to-3D reconstructions that demand full 3D scans. In\ncontrast, we introduce X-Diffusion, a novel cross-sectional diffusion model\nthat reconstructs detailed 3D MRI volumes from extremely sparse spatial-domain\ninputs, achieving 2D-to-3D reconstruction from as little as a single 2D MRI\nslice or few slices. A key aspect of X-Diffusion is that it models MRI data as\nholistic 3D volumes during the cross-sectional training and inference, unlike\nprevious learning approaches that treat MRI scans as collections of 2D slices\nin standard planes (coronal, axial, sagittal). We evaluated X-Diffusion on\nbrain tumor MRIs from the BRATS dataset and full-body MRIs from the UK Biobank\ndataset.

While recent\nmultimodal models have achieved significant progress by aligning pairs of\nmodalities via contrastive learning, their solutions are unsuitable when\nscaling to multiple modalities. These models typically align each modality to a\ndesignated anchor without ensuring the alignment of all modalities with each\nother, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks requiring a joint\nunderstanding of multiple modalities. In this paper, we structurally rethink\nthe pairwise conventional approach to multimodal learning and we present the\nnovel Gramian Representation Alignment Measure (GRAM), which overcomes the\nabove-mentioned limitations. GRAM learns and then aligns $n$ modalities\ndirectly in the higher-dimensional space in which modality embeddings lie by\nminimizing the Gramian volume of the $k$-dimensional parallelotope spanned by\nthe modality vectors, ensuring the geometric alignment of all modalities\nsimultaneously. GRAM can replace cosine similarity in any downstream method,\nholding for 2 to $n$ modalities and providing more meaningful alignment with\nrespect to previous similarity measures. The novel GRAM-based contrastive loss\nfunction enhances the alignment of multimodal models in the higher-dimensional\nembedding space, leading to new state-of-the-art performance in downstream\ntasks such as video-audio-text retrieval and audio-video classification.

In this paper, we propose Knowledge-Guided\nVisual representation learning (KGV) - a distribution-based learning approach\nleveraging multi-modal prior knowledge - to improve generalization under\ndistribution shift. It integrates knowledge from two distinct modalities: 1) a\nknowledge graph (KG) with hierarchical and association relationships; and 2)\ngenerated synthetic images of visual elements semantically represented in the\nKG. The respective embeddings are generated from the given modalities in a\ncommon latent space, i.e., visual embeddings from original and synthetic images\nas well as knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs). These embeddings are aligned via\na novel variant of translation-based KGE methods, where the node and relation\nembeddings of the KG are modeled as Gaussian distributions and translations,\nrespectively.

Yet,\nexisting methods have not managed to simultaneously have the properties of high\naccuracy, low uncertainty, and high computational efficiency. On one hand, to\nquantify the uncertainty in weather predictions, the strategy of ensemble\nforecast (i.e., generating a set of diverse predictions) is often employed.\nHowever, traditional ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) is\ncomputationally intensive. On the other hand, most existing machine\nlearning-based weather prediction (MLWP) approaches are efficient and accurate.\nNevertheless, they are deterministic and cannot capture the uncertainty of\nweather forecasting. In this work, we propose CoDiCast, a conditional diffusion\nmodel to generate accurate global weather prediction, while achieving\nuncertainty quantification with ensemble forecasts and modest computational\ncost. The key idea is to simulate a conditional version of the reverse\ndenoising process in diffusion models, which starts from pure Gaussian noise to\ngenerate realistic weather scenarios for a future time point. Each denoising\nstep is conditioned on observations from the recent past. Ensemble forecasts\nare achieved by repeatedly sampling from stochastic Gaussian noise to represent\nuncertainty quantification.

To\nmitigate this issue, quantization of diffusion models has been explored. It\nreduces memory usage and computational costs by compressing weights and\nactivations into lower-bit formats. However, existing methods often struggle to\npreserve both image quality and text-image alignment, particularly in\nlower-bit($<$ 8bits) quantization. In this paper, we analyze the challenges\nassociated with quantizing text-to-image diffusion models from a distributional\nperspective.

In offline-to-online learning, a\nlearner starts with offline data collected from interactions with an unknown\nenvironment in a way that is not under the learner's control. Given this data,\nthe learner begins interacting with the environment, gradually improving its\ninitial strategy as it collects more data to maximize its total reward. The\nlearner in this setting faces a fundamental dilemma: if the policy is deployed\nfor only a short period, a suitable strategy (in a number of senses) is the\nLower Confidence Bound (LCB) algorithm, which is based on pessimism. LCB can\neffectively compete with any policy that is sufficiently \"covered\" by the\noffline data. However, for longer time horizons, a preferred strategy is the\nUpper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, which is based on optimism. Over time,\nUCB converges to the performance of the optimal policy at a rate that is nearly\nthe best possible among all online algorithms. In offline-to-online learning,\nhowever, UCB initially explores excessively, leading to worse short-term\nperformance compared to LCB. This suggests that a learner not in control of how\nlong its policy will be in use should start with LCB for short horizons and\ngradually transition to a UCB-like strategy as more rounds are played. This\narticle explores how and why this transition should occur. Our main result\nshows that our new algorithm performs nearly as well as the better of LCB and\nUCB at any point in time.

Only a few prior\narchitectures execute the backpropagation and weight update, but they lack the\ncontrol and management for CL. Towards this, we design a hardware architecture,\nTinyCL, to perform CL on resource-constrained autonomous systems. It consists\nof a processing unit that executes both forward and backward propagation, and a\ncontrol unit that manages memory-based CL workload. To minimize the memory\naccesses, the sliding window of the convolutional layer moves in a snake-like\nfashion. Moreover, the Multiply-and-Accumulate units can be reconfigured at\nruntime to execute different operations. As per our knowledge, our proposed\nTinyCL represents the first hardware accelerator that executes CL on autonomous\nsystems. We synthesize the complete TinyCL architecture in a 65 nm CMOS\ntechnology node with the conventional ASIC design flow. It executes 1 epoch of\ntraining on a Conv + ReLU + Dense model on the CIFAR10 dataset in 1.76 s, while\n1 training epoch of the same model using an Nvidia Tesla P100 GPU takes 103 s,\nthus achieving a 58x speedup, consuming 86 mW in a 4.74 mm2 die.\n","authors":["Eugenio Ressa","Alberto Marchisio","Maurizio Martina","Guido Masera","Muhammad Shafique"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09780v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08231v1","updated":"2025-02-12T09:20:08Z","published":"2025-02-12T09:20:08Z","title":"Keep your distance: learning dispersed embeddings on $\\mathbb{S}_d$","summary":"  Learning well-separated features in high-dimensional spaces, such as text or\nimage embeddings, is crucial for many machine learning applications.

By\nconstraining features to be on a hypersphere, we can connect dispersion to\nwell-studied problems in mathematics and physics, where optimal solutions are\nknown for limited low-dimensional cases. However, in representation learning we\ntypically deal with a large number of features in high-dimensional space, and\nmoreover, dispersion is usually traded off with some other task-oriented\ntraining objective, making existing theoretical and numerical solutions\ninapplicable. Therefore, it is common to rely on gradient-based methods to\nencourage dispersion, usually by minimizing some function of the pairwise\ndistances.

Our results are\nobtained by extending the SPM technique for tuning the learning rates in the\nfollow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) framework, which further indicates that\nthe combination of SPM and FTRL is a promising approach for proving new\nadaptive bounds in online learning problems.\n","authors":["Quan Nguyen","Shinji Ito","Junpei Komiyama","Nishant A.

These agents can leverage their\nplanning and tool utilization capabilities to address tasks specified at a high\nlevel. However, a standardized dataset to benchmark the agent capabilities of\nLLMs in medical applications is currently lacking, making the evaluation of\nLLMs on complex tasks in interactive healthcare environments challenging. To\naddress this gap, we introduce MedAgentBench, a broad evaluation suite designed\nto assess the agent capabilities of large language models within medical\nrecords contexts. MedAgentBench encompasses 300 patient-specific\nclinically-derived tasks from 10 categories written by human physicians,\nrealistic profiles of 100 patients with over 700,000 data elements, a\nFHIR-compliant interactive environment, and an accompanying codebase.

This paper addresses the critical question\nof how to incorporate robustness into MoEs while maintaining high natural\naccuracy. We begin by analyzing the vulnerability of MoE components, finding\nthat expert networks are notably more susceptible to adversarial attacks than\nthe router. Based on this insight, we propose a targeted robust training\ntechnique that integrates a novel loss function to enhance the adversarial\nrobustness of MoE, requiring only the robustification of one additional expert\nwithout compromising training or inference efficiency. Building on this, we\nintroduce a dual-model strategy that linearly combines a standard MoE model\nwith our robustified MoE model using a smoothing parameter. This approach\nallows for flexible control over the robustness-accuracy trade-off. We further\nprovide theoretical foundations by deriving certified robustness bounds for\nboth the single MoE and the dual-model. To push the boundaries of robustness\nand accuracy, we propose a novel joint training strategy JTDMoE for the\ndual-model.

While previous recurrent neural network-based and\nattention-based approaches have achieved significant results, they have\nlimitations in capturing system continuity due to the discrete characteristics.\nIn the context of continuous-time modeling, state space model (SSM) offers a\npotential solution, as it can effectively capture the dynamic evolution of user\ninterest over time. However, existing SSM-based approaches ignore the impact of\nirregular time intervals within historical user interactions, making it\ndifficult to model complexed user-item transitions in sequences. To address\nthis issue, we propose a hybrid SSM-based model called SS4Rec for\ncontinuous-time sequential recommendation. SS4Rec integrates a time-aware SSM\nto handle irregular time intervals and a relation-aware SSM to model contextual\ndependencies, enabling it to infer user interest from both temporal and\nsequential perspectives. In the training process, the time-aware SSM and the\nrelation-aware SSM are discretized by variable stepsizes according to user\ninteraction time intervals and input data, respectively. This helps capture the\ncontinuous dependency from irregular time intervals and provides time-specific\npersonalized recommendations.

In this paper,\nwe study the fundamental data structure problem of maintaining approximate\nshortest paths in incremental graphs in the algorithms-with-predictions model.\nGiven a sequence $\\sigma$ of edges that are inserted one at a time, the goal is\nto maintain approximate shortest paths from the source to each vertex in the\ngraph at each time step. Before any edges arrive, the data structure is given a\nprediction of the online edge sequence $\\hat{\\sigma}$ which is used to ``warm\nstart'' its state.\n  As our main result, we design a learned algorithm that maintains\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate single-source shortest paths, which runs in\n$\\tilde{O}(m \\eta \\log W/\\epsilon)$ time, where $W$ is the weight of the\nheaviest edge and $\\eta$ is the prediction error. We show these techniques\nimmediately extend to the all-pairs shortest-path setting as well. Our\nalgorithms are consistent (performing nearly as fast as the offline algorithm)\nwhen predictions are nearly perfect, have a smooth degradation in performance\nwith respect to the prediction error and, in the worst case, match the best\noffline algorithm up to logarithmic factors.\n  As a building block, we study the offline incremental approximate\nsingle-source shortest-paths problem. In this problem, the edge sequence\n$\\sigma$ is known a priori and the goal is to efficiently return the length of\nthe shortest paths in the intermediate graph $G_t$ consisting of the first $t$\nedges, for all $t$.

Yet, in our work, we reveal that these current\nByzantine-robust techniques are not immune to our newly introduced Normalized\nattack. Distinct from previous attacks that targeted enlarging the distance of\npolicy updates before and after an attack, our Normalized attack emphasizes on\nmaximizing the angle of deviation between these updates. To counter these\nthreats, we develop an ensemble FRL approach that is provably secure against\nboth known and our newly proposed attacks. Our ensemble method involves\ntraining multiple global policies, where each is learnt by a group of agents\nusing any foundational aggregation rule. These well-trained global policies\nthen individually predict the action for a specific test state.

Despite its\nprevalence and importance, handling distribution shifts in the tabular domain\nremains underexplored due to the inherent challenges within the tabular data\nitself. In this sense, test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising solution\nby adapting models to target data without accessing source data, crucial for\nprivacy-sensitive tabular domains. However, existing TTA methods either 1)\noverlook the nature of tabular distribution shifts, often involving label\ndistribution shifts, or 2) impose architectural constraints on the model,\nleading to a lack of applicability. To this end, we propose AdapTable, a novel\nTTA framework for tabular data.

In\nparticular, an auxiliary momentum variable was algorithmically introduced to\nhelp transport the position variable between data distribution and a fixed,\neasy-to-sample distribution. Normally, this would incur further difficulty for\nmanifold data because momentum lives in a space that changes with the position.\nHowever, our trivialization technique creates a new momentum variable that\nstays in a simple fixed vector space.

In this paper, we present Ola, an Omni-modal language model\nthat achieves competitive performance across image, video, and audio\nunderstanding compared to specialized counterparts. The core design of Ola lies\nin its progressive modality alignment strategy that extends the supporting\nmodality of the language model progressively. Our training pipeline begins with\nthe most distinct modalities: image and text, then gradually expands the skill\nsets of the model using speech data that connects language and audio knowledge,\nand video data that connects all modalities. The progressive learning pipeline\nalso enables us to maintain a relatively small size of the cross-modal\nalignment data, making developing omni-modal from existing vision-language\nmodels easy and less costly.

Many\nmachine learning problems can be formulated as quadratic programming, including\nthe famous Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Linear and kernel SVMs have been\namong the most popular models in machine learning over the past three decades,\nprior to the deep learning era.\n  Generally, a quadratic program has an input size of $\\Theta(n^2)$, where $n$\nis the number of variables. Assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis\n($\\textsf{SETH}$), it is known that no $O(n^{2-o(1)})$ time algorithm exists\nwhen the quadratic objective matrix is positive semidefinite (Backurs, Indyk,\nand Schmidt, NeurIPS'17). However, problems such as SVMs usually admit much\nsmaller input sizes: one is given $n$ data points, each of dimension $d$, and\n$d$ is oftentimes much smaller than $n$. Furthermore, the SVM program has only\n$O(1)$ equality linear constraints. This suggests that faster algorithms are\nfeasible, provided the program exhibits certain structures.\n  In this work, we design the first nearly-linear time algorithm for solving\nquadratic programs whenever the quadratic objective admits a low-rank\nfactorization, and the number of linear constraints is small. Consequently, we\nobtain results for SVMs:\n  * For linear SVM when the input data is $d$-dimensional, our algorithm runs\nin time $\\widetilde O(nd^{(\\omega+1)/2}\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ where $\\omega\\approx\n2.37$ is the fast matrix multiplication exponent;\n  * For Gaussian kernel SVM, when the data dimension $d = {\\color{black}O(\\log\nn)}$ and the squared dataset radius is sub-logarithmic in $n$, our algorithm\nruns in time $O(n^{1+o(1)}\\log(1/\\epsilon))$.

While many calibration methods use analytical\napproaches, machine learning techniques have recently gained attention due to\ntheir flexibility. We developed a residual physics-based calibration approach\nthat combines prior domain knowledge with the power of machine learning models.\nThis approach begins with an initial analytical calibration addressing\nfirst-order skews. The remaining deviations, regarded as residual effects, are\nused to train machine learning models to eliminate higher-order skews.

Due to\nthe high cost and time-consuming nature of human evaluations, an automatic LLM\nbencher (i.e., an automatic evaluation framework that aims to rank LLMs based\non their alignment with human preferences) is indispensable. An automatic LLM\nbencher consists of four components: the input set (e.g., a user instruction),\nthe evaluation model (e.g., an LLM), the evaluation type (e.g., pairwise\ncomparison), and the aggregation method (e.g., the ELO rating system).

In this work, through\ncontrolled experiments, we provide a series of recommendations on how to choose\neach component to better automate the evaluation of LLMs. Furthermore, we\ndiscovered that when evaluating LLMs with similar performance, the performance\nof the automatic LLM bencher declines sharply, underscoring the limitations of\ncurrent benchers and calling for future work.

In\nparticular, when performing inference on observations outside of the scope of\nthe simulated data seen during training, for example, because of model\nmisspecification, the posterior approximations are likely to become highly\nbiased. Due to the bad pre-asymptotic behavior of current neural posterior\nestimators in the out-of-simulation regime, the resulting estimation biases\ncannot be fixed in acceptable time by just simulating more training data. In\nthis proof-of-concept paper, we propose a semi-supervised approach that enables\ntraining not only on (labeled) simulated data generated from the model, but\nalso on unlabeled data originating from any source, including real-world data.\nTo achieve the latter, we exploit Bayesian self-consistency properties that can\nbe transformed into strictly proper losses without requiring knowledge of true\nparameter values, that is, without requiring data labels. The results of our\ninitial experiments show remarkable improvements in the robustness of ABI on\nout-of-simulation data.

Still, the reward mechanism available in\ndecentralized systems, motivates the adversary to act rationally. While the\ndecoder, as the data collector (DC), has an acceptance and rejection mechanism,\nfollowed by an estimation module, the adversary aims to maximize its utility,\nas an increasing function of (1) the chance of acceptance (to increase the\nreward), and (2) estimation error. On the other hand, the decoder also adjusts\nits acceptance rule to maximize its own utility, as (1) an increasing function\nof the chance of acceptance (to keep the system functional), (2) decreasing\nfunction of the estimation error. Prior works within this framework rely on the\nassumption that the game is complete, that is, both the DC and the adversary\nare fully aware of each other's utility functions.

This paper presents a novel machine learning (ML) model, called\nMiMa (short for Micro-Macro), that integrates both near-surface observational\ndata from Kentucky Mesonet stations (collected every five minutes, known as\nMicro data) and hourly atmospheric numerical outputs (termed as Macro data) for\nfine-resolution weather forecasting. The MiMa model employs an encoder-decoder\ntransformer structure, with two encoders for processing multivariate data from\nboth datasets and a decoder for forecasting weather variables over short time\nhorizons. Each instance of the MiMa model, called a modelet, predicts the\nvalues of a specific weather parameter at an individual Mesonet station. The\napproach is extended with Re-MiMa modelets, which are designed to predict\nweather variables at ungauged locations by training on multivariate data from a\nfew representative stations in a region, tagged with their elevations. Re-MiMa\n(short for Regional-MiMa) can provide highly accurate predictions across an\nentire region, even in areas without observational stations. Experimental\nresults show that MiMa significantly outperforms current models, with Re-MiMa\noffering precise short-term forecasts for ungauged locations, marking a\nsignificant advancement in weather forecasting accuracy and applicability.\n","authors":["Yihe Zhang","Bryce Turney","Purushottam Sigdel","Xu Yuan","Eric Rappin","Adrian Lago","Sytske Kimball","Li Chen","Paul Darby","Lu Peng","Sercan Aygun","Yazhou Tu","M.

Yet, in practice, this assumption rarely holds, as\nfor many samples only a subset of the clients observe their partition. However,\nnot utilizing incomplete samples during training harms generalization, and not\nsupporting them during inference limits the utility of the model. Moreover, if\nany client leaves the federation after training, its partition becomes\nunavailable, rendering the learned model unusable. Missing feature blocks are\ntherefore a key challenge limiting the applicability of vertical federated\nlearning in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose LASER-VFL, a\nvertical federated learning method for efficient training and inference of\nsplit neural network-based models that is capable of handling arbitrary sets of\npartitions.

Our study reveals several critical\ninsights: first, ML fleets extend beyond the hardware layer, with model, data,\nframework, compiler, and scheduling layers significantly impacting performance;\nsecond, the heterogeneous nature of ML fleets poses challenges in\ncharacterizing individual workload performance; and third, traditional\nutilization-based metrics prove insufficient for ML fleet characterization. To\naddress these challenges, we present the \"ML Productivity Goodput\" (MPG) metric\nto measure ML fleet efficiency. We show how to leverage this metric to\ncharacterize the fleet across the ML system stack. We also present methods to\nidentify and optimize performance bottlenecks using MPG, providing strategies\nfor managing warehouse-scale ML systems in general. Lastly, we demonstrate\nquantitative evaluations from applying these methods to a real ML fleet for\ninternal-facing Google TPU workloads, where we observed tangible improvements.\n","authors":["Arissa Wongpanich","Tayo Oguntebi","Jose Baiocchi Paredes","Yu Emma Wang","Phitchaya Mangpo Phothilimthana","Ritwika Mitra","Zongwei Zhou","Naveen Kumar","Vijay Janapa Reddi"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06982v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06978v1","updated":"2025-02-10T19:18:18Z","published":"2025-02-10T19:18:18Z","title":"Dual Conic Proxy for Semidefinite Relaxation of AC Optimal Power Flow","summary":"  The nonlinear, non-convex AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem is\nfundamental for power systems operations. The intrinsic complexity of AC-OPF\nhas fueled a growing interest in the development of optimization proxies for\nthe problem, i.e., machine learning models that predict high-quality,\nclose-to-optimal solutions. More recently, dual conic proxy architectures have\nbeen proposed, which combine machine learning and convex relaxations of AC-OPF,\nto provide valid certificates of optimality using learning-based methods.\nBuilding on this methodology, this paper proposes, for the first time, a dual\nconic proxy architecture for the semidefinite (SDP) relaxation of AC-OPF\nproblems. Although the SDP relaxation is stronger than the second-order cone\nrelaxation considered in previous work, its practical use has been hindered by\nits computational cost. The proposed method combines a neural network with a\ndifferentiable dual completion strategy that leverages the structure of the\ndual SDP problem. This approach guarantees dual feasibility, and therefore\nvalid dual bounds, while providing orders of magnitude of speedups compared to\ninterior-point algorithms. The paper also leverages self-supervised learning,\nwhich alleviates the need for time-consuming data generation and allows to\ntrain the proposed models efficiently. Numerical experiments are presented on\nseveral power grid benchmarks with up to 500 buses. The results demonstrate\nthat the proposed SDP-based proxies can outperform weaker conic relaxations,\nwhile providing several orders of magnitude speedups compared to a\nstate-of-the-art interior-point SDP solver.\n","authors":["Guancheng Qiu","Mathieu Tanneau","Pascal Van Hentenryck"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06978v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06971v1","updated":"2025-02-10T19:12:12Z","published":"2025-02-10T19:12:12Z","title":"User-Preference Meets Pareto-Optimality: Multi-Objective Bayesian\n  Optimization with Local Gradient Search","summary":"  Incorporating user preferences into multi-objective Bayesian optimization\n(MOBO) allows for personalization of the optimization procedure. Preferences\nare often abstracted in the form of an unknown utility function, estimated\nthrough pairwise comparisons of potential outcomes. However, utility-driven\nMOBO methods can yield solutions that are dominated by nearby solutions, as\nnon-dominance is not enforced. Additionally, classical MOBO commonly relies on\nestimating the entire Pareto-front to identify the Pareto-optimal solutions,\nwhich can be expensive and ignore user preferences. Here, we present a new\nmethod, termed preference-utility-balanced MOBO (PUB-MOBO), that allows users\nto disambiguate between near-Pareto candidate solutions. PUB-MOBO combines\nutility-based MOBO with local multi-gradient descent to refine user-preferred\nsolutions to be near-Pareto-optimal. To this end, we propose a novel\npreference-dominated utility function that concurrently preserves\nuser-preferences and dominance amongst candidate solutions. A key advantage of\nPUB-MOBO is that the local search is restricted to a (small) region of the\nPareto-front directed by user preferences, alleviating the need to estimate the\nentire Pareto-front. PUB-MOBO is tested on three synthetic benchmark problems:\nDTLZ1, DTLZ2 and DH1, as well as on three real-world problems: Vehicle Safety,\nConceptual Marine Design, and Car Side Impact.

However, quantizing models -- especially to\nlow precisions like int4 or int2 -- requires a trade-off in model quality;\nint2, in particular, is known to severely degrade model quality. Consequently,\npractitioners are often forced to maintain multiple models with different\nquantization levels or serve a single model that best satisfies the\nquality-latency trade-off.

This\npaper proposes Matryoshka Quantization (MatQuant), a novel multi-scale\nquantization technique that addresses the challenge of needing multiple\nquantized models. It allows training and maintaining just one model, which can\nthen be served at different precision levels. Furthermore, due to the\nco-training and co-distillation regularization provided by MatQuant, the int2\nprecision models extracted by MatQuant can be up to $10\\%$ more accurate than\nstandard int2 quantization (using techniques like QAT or OmniQuant).

However, as\nMoE models scale, they need to be distributed across GPU devices, thus face\ncritical performance bottlenecks due to their large memory footprint. Expert\nparallelism distributes experts across GPUs, however, faces key challenges\nincluding an unbalanced token routing and expert activation, resulting in\ncommunication tail latency and processing inefficiencies. While existing\nsolutions address some of these issues, they fail to resolve the dual\nchallenges of load imbalance and communication skew. The imbalance in token\nprocessing load across experts causes uneven processing times on different\nGPUs, while communication skew between GPUs leads to unbalanced inter-GPU data\ntransfers. These factors degrade the performance of MoE models by increasing\ntail latency and reducing overall throughput. To address these limitations, we\npropose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation to optimize expert\nplacement by jointly considering token load, communication, and computation\ncosts.

This work presents the first systematic investigation in\nunderstanding, analyzing, and mitigating bias inheritance. We study this\nproblem by fine-tuning LLMs with a combined dataset consisting of original and\nLLM-augmented data, where bias ratio represents the proportion of augmented\ndata.

Our strategy is to use equivariant and invariant\nparametrizations and train in a self-supervised way. We design a deep neural\nmodel outputting factorized unimodular matrices and train it in a\nself-supervised manner by penalizing non-orthogonal lattice bases. We\nincorporate the symmetries of lattice reduction into the model by making it\ninvariant to isometries and scaling of the ambient space and equivariant with\nrespect to the hyperocrahedral group permuting and flipping the lattice basis\nelements. We show that this approach yields an algorithm with comparable\ncomplexity and performance to the LLL algorithm on a set of benchmarks.\nAdditionally, motivated by certain applications for wireless communication, we\nextend our method to a convolutional architecture which performs joint\nreduction of spatially-correlated lattices arranged in a grid, thereby\namortizing its cost over multiple lattices.\n","authors":["Giovanni Luca Marchetti","Gabriele Cesa","Pratik Kumar","Arash Behboodi"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08170v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted at TMLR"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06282v2","updated":"2025-02-10T13:54:27Z","published":"2024-09-10T07:34:19Z","title":"Automated Data Augmentation for Few-Shot Time Series Forecasting: A\n  Reinforcement Learning Approach Guided by a Model Zoo","summary":"  Time series forecasting, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios, is\nchallenging due to the limited availability of high-quality training data.

Existing\nworks formulated this challenge as a long-tailed problem and attempted to\ntackle it by decoupling the feature representation and classification. Yet, due\nto the imbalanced distribution and limited samples from tail classes, these\nworks are prone to biased representation learning and insufficient classifier\ncalibration. To tackle these problems, we propose a new Long-tailed Medical\nDiagnosis (LMD) framework for balanced medical image classification on\nlong-tailed datasets.

While\nrecent advancements in multi-view joint diffusion for panoramic generation\nprovide an efficient option, they struggle with spectrum generation with severe\noverlap distortions and high cross-view consistency costs. We initially explore\nthis phenomenon through the connectivity inheritance of latent maps and uncover\nthat averaging operations excessively smooth the high-frequency components of\nthe latent map. To address these issues, we propose Swap Forward (SaFa), a\nframe-level latent swap framework that synchronizes multiple diffusions to\nproduce a globally coherent long audio with more spectrum details in a\nforward-only manner. At its core, the bidirectional Self-Loop Latent Swap is\napplied between adjacent views, leveraging stepwise diffusion trajectory to\nadaptively enhance high-frequency components without disrupting low-frequency\ncomponents. Furthermore, to ensure cross-view consistency, the unidirectional\nReference-Guided Latent Swap is applied between the reference and the\nnon-overlap regions of each subview during the early stages, providing\ncentralized trajectory guidance. Quantitative and qualitative experiments\ndemonstrate that SaFa significantly outperforms existing joint diffusion\nmethods and even training-based long audio generation models.

To address this, we propose the Visual Implicit Knowledge\nDistillation Framework (VIKDF), an innovative approach aimed at enhancing LLMs\nfor enriched dialogue generation in zero-resource contexts by leveraging\nimplicit multimodal knowledge. VIKDF comprises two main stages: knowledge\ndistillation, using an Implicit Query Transformer to extract and encode visual\nimplicit knowledge from image-text pairs into knowledge vectors; and knowledge\nintegration, employing a novel Bidirectional Variational Information Fusion\ntechnique to seamlessly integrate these distilled vectors into LLMs. This\nenables the LLMs to generate dialogues that are not only coherent and engaging\nbut also exhibit a deep understanding of the context through implicit\nmultimodal cues, effectively overcoming the limitations of zero-resource\nscenarios.

Our experimental results\nconfirm that our model retains more paralinguistic information from the source\nspeech while maintaining high standards of translation accuracy and\nnaturalness.\n","authors":["Anna Min","Chenxu Hu","Yi Ren","Hang Zhao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00374v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00358v1","updated":"2025-02-01T07:40:29Z","published":"2025-02-01T07:40:29Z","title":"Do Audio-Visual Segmentation Models Truly Segment Sounding Objects?","summary":"  Unlike traditional visual segmentation, audio-visual segmentation (AVS)\nrequires the model not only to identify and segment objects but also to\ndetermine whether they are sound sources. Recent AVS approaches, leveraging\ntransformer architectures and powerful foundation models like SAM, have\nachieved impressive performance on standard benchmarks. Yet, an important\nquestion remains: Do these models genuinely integrate audio-visual cues to\nsegment sounding objects? In this paper, we systematically investigate this\nissue in the context of robust AVS. Our study reveals a fundamental bias in\ncurrent methods: they tend to generate segmentation masks based predominantly\non visual salience, irrespective of the audio context. This bias results in\nunreliable predictions when sounds are absent or irrelevant. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce AVSBench-Robust, a comprehensive benchmark\nincorporating diverse negative audio scenarios including silence, ambient\nnoise, and off-screen sounds. We also propose a simple yet effective approach\ncombining balanced training with negative samples and classifier-guided\nsimilarity learning. Our extensive experiments show that state-of-theart AVS\nmethods consistently fail under negative audio conditions, demonstrating the\nprevalence of visual bias. In contrast, our approach achieves remarkable\nimprovements in both standard metrics and robustness measures, maintaining\nnear-perfect false positive rates while preserving highquality segmentation\nperformance.\n","authors":["Jia Li","Wenjie Zhao","Ziru Huang","Yunhui Guo","Yapeng Tian"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00358v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10292v3","updated":"2025-02-01T01:56:33Z","published":"2024-04-16T05:29:14Z","title":"From Data Deluge to Data Curation: A Filtering-WoRA Paradigm for\n  Efficient Text-based Person Search","summary":"  In text-based person search endeavors, data generation has emerged as a\nprevailing practice, addressing concerns over privacy preservation and the\narduous task of manual annotation. Although the number of synthesized data can\nbe infinite in theory, the scientific conundrum persists that how much\ngenerated data optimally fuels subsequent model training. We observe that only\na subset of the data in these constructed datasets plays a decisive role.\nTherefore, we introduce a new Filtering-WoRA paradigm, which contains a\nfiltering algorithm to identify this crucial data subset and WoRA (Weighted\nLow-Rank Adaptation) learning strategy for light fine-tuning. The filtering\nalgorithm is based on the cross-modality relevance to remove the lots of coarse\nmatching synthesis pairs. As the number of data decreases, we do not need to\nfine-tune the entire model. Therefore, we propose a WoRA learning strategy to\nefficiently update a minimal portion of model parameters. WoRA streamlines the\nlearning process, enabling heightened efficiency in extracting knowledge from\nfewer, yet potent, data instances. Extensive experimentation validates the\nefficacy of pretraining, where our model achieves advanced and efficient\nretrieval performance on challenging real-world benchmarks. Notably, on the\nCUHK-PEDES dataset, we have achieved a competitive mAP of 67.02% while reducing\nmodel training time by 19.82%.\n","authors":["Jintao Sun","Hao Fei","Zhedong Zheng","Gangyi Ding"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10292v3.pdf","comment":"11 pages, 8 figures, Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2025 (WWW\n  '25)"}]},"2025-01-31T00:00:00Z":{"Multimedia":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11403v2","updated":"2025-01-31T10:08:36Z","published":"2025-01-20T11:06:05Z","title":"Verifying Cross-modal Entity Consistency in News using Vision-language\n  Models","summary":"  The web has become a crucial source of information, but it is also used to\nspread disinformation, often conveyed through multiple modalities like images\nand text. The identification of inconsistent cross-modal information, in\nparticular entities such as persons, locations, and events, is critical to\ndetect disinformation. Previous works either identify out-of-context\ndisinformation by assessing the consistency of images to the whole document,\nneglecting relations of individual entities, or focus on generic entities that\nare not relevant to news. So far, only few approaches have addressed the task\nof validating entity consistency between images and text in news. However, the\npotential of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has not been explored yet. In\nthis paper, we propose an LVLM-based framework for verifying Cross-modal Entity\nConsistency~(LVLM4CEC), to assess whether persons, locations and events in news\narticles are consistent across both modalities. We suggest effective prompting\nstrategies for LVLMs for entity verification that leverage reference images\ncrawled from web. Moreover, we extend three existing datasets for the task of\nentity verification in news providing manual ground-truth data. Our results\nshow the potential of LVLMs for automating cross-modal entity verification,\nshowing improved accuracy in identifying persons and events when using evidence\nimages. Moreover, our method outperforms a baseline for location and event\nverification in documents.
